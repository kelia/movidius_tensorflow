# Inference for tensorflow models on the Movidius Neural Compute Stick (NCS)

The documentation of openvino gives many examples, how to run specific network architectures by converting the model using their model optimizer. However, I could not find a single example that starts at the actual tensorflow code, and porting the model to the graph version needed for inference using the inference engine. 

This repo aims at giving two examples of the workflow, specifically the following two architectures will be covered:
 - simple, two-layer network (conv layer followed by fully connected layer, no activation functions)
 - simple convolutional network with some residual connections and two fully connected heads.
